			<p id= "all"><br>Hi, I'm Brianne! I'm a current coding bootcamp student at the Rutgers Univeristy Coding Bootcamp in Jersey City, NJ. I graduated in May of 2015 from Rutgers Univeristy in New Brunswick with a B.A. in Linguistics and Psychology.  <br><br>
				I look at learning to code in the same way that I learned and studied languages as a Linguistics major. All languages, including computer programming languages, have a pattern that they follow. The trick to figuring them out is to learn and practice that pattern until you are fluent in that language. As a student in a coding bootcamp, I have already learned HTML and CSS, as well as how to use Github and Bootstrap.<br><br>
				I am currently learning Javascript and JQuery as a student at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. While I have no previous formal education in web develeopment, I am finding that I am learning the concepts very rapidly. I hope to become more skilled at both of these and learn many others throughout the course!<br><br>
